Because BizQuiz is an iOS app, a Mac with XCode installed is required to run on an iOS device. To run the application, first open the .xcodeproj file. To run on a physical device, any developer account is required to be signed in. Plug the physical device in with an iTunes cable and click Product in the menu bar, then Run. If this is not possible, running on an iOS simulator is possible, but some functions, such as social media integration, are not supported. Click a simulator from the list of devices next to the app name at the top left of the IDE and Run the app.
